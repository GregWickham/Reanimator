**The world is full of old software, running all types of businesses in all types of industries.**

In our personal lives, we're all accustomed to smartphones, tablets, and cloud services; but if you step behind the counter in one of those businesses and look at the dusty 14 inch CRT used by the hourly employees, chances are you'll see something like this:

Sure, all those employees have smartphones for their personal use.  They have other computers in the back office, running web-enabled Windows applications.  And yet the software that tracks their sales and inventory may not have changed in 20 or 30 years.

**But why?**  Why haven't they ripped that out and replaced it with something modern?

The business owner probably chose that software package decades ago when it was state-of-the-art.  The business has grown up around that software.  The staff are trained and experienced in its use; and it's tightly integrated into their supply chain.  Most important, that software contains the mission-critical data that keeps the business running.  Replacing it would be costly and disruptive.  To the owner, ripping out that "obsolete" software and replacing it looks like a huge, expensive headache.

At the same time, the owner is well aware that technology has moved on.
