**The world is full of legacy software, running all types of businesses in all types of industries.**

In our personal lives we're all accustomed to smartphones, tablets, and cloud services; but if you step behind the counter in one of those businesses and look at the dusty 14 inch CRT used by the hourly employees, chances are you'll see something like this:

Sure, all those employees have smartphones for their personal use.  They have other computers in the back office, running web-enabled Windows applications.  Yet the software that tracks their sales, inventory, accounting and payroll may not have changed in 20 or 30 years.

**But why?**  Why haven't they ripped that out and replaced it with something modern?

The business owner probably chose that software package decades ago when it was state-of-the-art.  The business has grown up around that software.  The staff are trained and experienced in its use; and it's tightly integrated into their supply chain.  Most important, that software contains the mission-critical data that keeps the business running.  Replacing it would be costly and disruptive.  To the owner, ripping out that "obsolete" software and replacing it looks like a huge, expensive headache.

At the same time, the owner is well aware that technology has moved on.  It would be great if they could integrate that old software with other, modern systems -- Ecommerce, mobile devices, web services, etc -- but they just don't know how.

## Reanimator

What if that business had a software adapter layer that could operate the user interface of their old software, as if the old software had a rich developer API -- extracting data and exporting it to other systems, and performing the same functions that employees do when they use the software?  That's what **Reanimator** does.

You can use that ability to put new GUI skins on top of old functionalty, changing workflow or just updating the look and feel.  You can use it to add service endpoints to the old software, so its functionalty can be accessed from web portals, mobile devices, or whatever.  You can mine the data in the old system, and present it to users in a new way.

Here are some examples of applications I've done with a legacy system called WDS-II:
